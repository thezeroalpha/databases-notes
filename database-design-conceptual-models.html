Three phases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
conceptual:

<ul>
<li>
what do we store

<li>
how are the elements related to each other

<li>
what are the constraints

<li>
models: Entity/Relationship, UML

</ul>
<li>
logical:

<ul>
<li>
transform conceptual schema into the schema supported by the database

<li>
models: relational model

</ul>
<li>
physical:

<ul>
<li>
design indices, table distribution, buffer sizes, etc.

<li>
try to maximise performance of the final system

</ul>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
static, models the structure and not operations. no methods or functions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
rectangles represent entity sets

<li>
ellipses represent attributes

<ul>
<li>
double line - multivalued attributes

<li>
dashed line - derived attributes

</ul>
<li>
diamonds are relationship sets

<li>
lines link attributes and relationship sets to entity sets

<li>
underline indicates primary key attributes

</ul>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets"><h4 id="Entity sets" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets">Entity sets</a></h4></div>
<p>
entity is an abstract object (person, company, event..)
</p>

<p>
entitties have attributes (names, addresses, ...)
</p>

<p>
entity set is is a collection of similar entities (those sharing the same attributes).
</p>

<p>
represented by a set of attributes - descriptive properties possessed by all entities. the domain is set of permitted values for each attribute.
</p>

<p>
attribute types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
simple and composite (e.g. street is composed of street name and number)

<li>
number of values:

<ul>
<li>
single-valued: e.g. age of a person

<li>
multivalued: e.g. person can have multiple phone numbers

</ul>
<li>
derived attributes:

<ul>
<li>
can be computed from other attributes

<li>
e.g. age computed from date of birth

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets-Weak entity sets"><h5 id="Weak entity sets" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets-Weak entity sets">Weak entity sets</a></h5></div>
<p>
a weak entity set doesn't have a primary key. its existence depends on existence of an identifying entity set.
</p>

<p>
there has to be a total, one-to-may relationship set from identifying to weak entity set, shown by double diamond.
</p>

<p>
discriminator: a partial key, distinguishing weak entity only in combination with identifying entity. denoted by dashed underline.
</p>

<p>
primary key of weak entity set is combination of discriminator and primary key of identifying entity set.
</p>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Relationship sets"><h4 id="Relationship sets" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Relationship sets">Relationship sets</a></h4></div>
<p>
a relationship is association among several entities (a tuple (e₁, e₂, ...) of entities)
</p>

<p>
a relationship set is a set of relationship of same kind. i.e. a set of tuples (e₁, e₂, ...) where e₁ ∈ E₁, e₂ ∈ E₂, etc. Can have attributes.
</p>

<p>
example in UML with a relationship set <em>plays-in</em> and role indicators:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/relationship-set-example.png" alt="Relationship set example" />
</p>

<p>
cardinality limits express number of entities to which another entity can be associated via relationship set:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
0...1 means zero or one

<li>
1...1 means precisely one

<li>
0...* means any number

<li>
1...* means at least one

</ul>

<p>
if cardinalities are not given, the default is many-to-many.
</p>

<p>
total participation: every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship in the relationship set
</p>

<p>
partial participation: entities may not participate in any relationship in the set
</p>

<p>
degree of a relationship set is number of entity sets participating in the relationship.
</p>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Is-a (inheritance)"><h4 id="Is-a (inheritance)" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Is-a (inheritance)">Is-a (inheritance)</a></h4></div>
<p>
lower-level entity sets are subgroups of the higher-level entity sets (e.g. an employee 'is a' person)
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/is-a-example.png" alt="Is a example" />
</p>

<p>
lower-level entity sets inherit all attributes and relationships of the higher-level entity sets
</p>

<p>
you can go top-down and find subgroups (specialisation) or bottom-up and combine entity sets (generalisation)
</p>

<p>
constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
membership: value-based, assigns entity to subclass based on attribute values

<li>
disjointness: an entity can belong to at most one subclass (default is overlapping, where it can belong to multiple)

<li>
completeness: total specialisation, each superclass entity must belong to a subclass

</ul>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Aggregation"><h4 id="Aggregation" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Aggregation">Aggregation</a></h4></div>
<p>
treat relationship set as an abstract entity. allows relations between relations.
</p>

<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Summary"><h4 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Summary">Summary</a></h4></div>

</p>


<div id="Database design: Conceptual models-UML vs ER"><h3 id="UML vs ER" class="header"><a href="#Database design: Conceptual models-UML vs ER">UML vs ER</a></h3></div>
<p>
attributes are shown within box of entity set, not as separate ellipses.
</p>

<p>
binary relationships are a line connecting entity sets, with name of relationship next to line.
</p>

<p>
if relationship set has attributes, name of relationship set is written in box along with attributes of relation; box is connected with dashed line to the relation line.
</p>

<p>
non-binary relationship sets are drawn with a diamond.
</p>

<p>
important differences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
keys:

<ul>
<li>
ER supports keys with underlining

<li>
UML has no standard for keys

</ul>
<li>
aggregation:

<ul>
<li>
ER: treating relationship set as entity

<li>
UML: part-whole relation (non-exclusive composition)

</ul>
<li>
weak entities:

<ul>
<li>
ER: entities without own key

<li>
UML: composition is similar, but says nothing about keys

</ul>
</ul>
